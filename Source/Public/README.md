# VSTeam-Plus Public Functions

Place all your public functions in this folder. Create a single file per function. Name the file after the function using verb-noun format. Each function in this folder will be exported by the module.

For functions you do not want exported place in the Private folder.

All the files in this folder will be combined into a single file based on _functions.json.

You can safely delete this folder if you do not have any public functions.
