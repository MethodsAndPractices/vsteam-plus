# VSTeam-Plus Classes

This folder is where you place any classes you need for your functions. Update the _classes.json file to define the load order of the files. Use the files array to list your classes.

```json
"files": [
    'myClass.ps1'
]
```

All the files in this folder will be combined into a single file based on _classes.json.

You can safely delete this folder if you do not have any classes.
